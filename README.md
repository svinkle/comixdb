# ComixDB

## Update
Comic Vine kindly asked me to cease operations, but I'm keeping the source code up for anyone who's interested.

## About
Accessing the ComicVine.com API to deliver a device agnostic web app to search their massive database of comic awesome.

ComixDB is currently in Beta status. Current feature set includes:

* Search for you favorite Super Heroes!
* Works on your desktop computer, mobile phone, HDTV (including all major game consoles), your car dashboard, and even your toaster!
* Coming soon: Search by Location, Team, Publisher, and Movies!

## Status
No longer in development, still works with limited functionality: http://svinkle.github.io/comixdb/
